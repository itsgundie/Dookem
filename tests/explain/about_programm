How to use this simple prototype?
make
./tests *map_name*
or
./tests "New map" *map_name* (it should be existing empty file,
                            where new data will be placed)

1) ./tests "New map" *map_name*

to draw new wall's of single sector. Every new wall will be colored
in white.
The first wall will have start in first click position, every next
wall with start in previous wall's end.

2) ./tests *map_name*
You can try following combinations:
./tests ./maps/1
        ./maps/3
        ./maps/4
        or any another map that was made with programm.

Player is a red dot on screen with white vector - direction.
You can move him/her by w(go forward), s(go back), left and
right arrows. If player is placed in sector, whole screen
will be colored in blue, if he/she is not - screen will be
green.
