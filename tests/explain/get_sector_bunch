Finding possible vision walls.

It is pretty bad algorithm, but the only one for this moment.

So,
1) Select all walls, that placed in direction of player's eyes.
It was made by vector cross product formulas. Source code you
can see here:

2) Than we are calculating distance (depth) between wall and player's position.
It works almost right - to see more information read this topic carefully:
grafika.me/node/980#:~:text=Расстоянием%20от%20точки%20до%20отрезка,до%20одного%20из%20концов%20отрезка

3) Than I guess I'm gonna sort all walls by them depth.
4) After that I'll check carefully, if walls from the end of list
are overlap with walls from the begin. Every overlap wall will be
removed from the list. There will be only those walls, that are
visible for player for now.
