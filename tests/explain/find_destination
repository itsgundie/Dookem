Well, lets fun part begin.

The smallest distance from player to wall (segment, that is indicated by 2 vertexes),
is length of perpendicular, one of vertexes of which is our player's pos, and the
second should be placed on our wall. If this perpendicular doesn't exist, required
value is distance from player to the nearest wall's vertex.

As we see in the 1_illustration.png, if perpendicular doesn't correspond this
demands, destination could be incorrect.

Finding hit was made very familiar as wall's clipping.

At first, we know, that line, which is perpendicular to given, would have
angular coefficient, satisfying the equation:
k1 * k2 = -1.

k1 and k2 are tangents of angle. So, our perpendicular should be such a line,
that have one point in player's pos, and angle atan(k2). And we already know,
how to find crossing point of two lines (what is this, crossover episode?).

Soooooooo we did it!
