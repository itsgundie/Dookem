In this tests I'm trying to figure out if we can use non-convex
sectors in our engine.
Targets:
1) Can we recognise in which sector is player placed? YES!!! See explain/inside.c and explain/inside.txt
2) Can we know for sure which walls are visible right now?
3) Can we count visible segment for every wall?

To see your current tasks, run "show_targets.sh"
